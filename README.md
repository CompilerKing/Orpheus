# Orpheus
This is a 2d platformer game we developed in a 48 hour period for the Bacon Game Jam #9.
It was developed using Unity's 2d environment.
Our game on the main website: https://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-09/345/

Unfortunately, I used SourceTree for this project which did not have my git email set correctly so while the commits do have my name on them, They are not directly linked to this account.
